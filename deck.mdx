## What is our goal?

Solve <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>challenging</span> problems and leverage <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>collaboration</span>.

## Why is this valuable? 

There are 2 prevailing methods to enhance knowledge understanding, aquisition, and retention.

1. [Spaced repetition](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/52d7/5ac6080842077877219003dbfbcbea36020f.pdf)
   - Spaced practice enhances memory, problem solving,
and transfer of learning to new contexts.
2. [Learning by teaching](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361476X13000209?via%3Dihub#ab005)
   - Students who actually taught experienced more persistent learning gains.

## So how are we going to accomplish this today?

1. Work on some coding challenges
2. Work within groups to complete them
3. Explain the problem and solution to our group

---

## Getting setup:

1. <img style={{height: 60}} src='https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T024G4BGQ/team1/34f58fd517ff961d.png'/> Get into groups of 3 or 4
2. 🕸 Go to [`i.imnick.dev/leet`](https://i.imnick.dev/leet)
3. 👩‍💻 Clone the repo to your laptop
4. 🤔 Pick a problem to solve

## Problems

1. Two Sum
2. Valid Parentheses
3. Trapping Rain Water
4. Median Two Sorted Arrays
5. Linked List Deep Copy


---

### Two Sum

> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

```
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

return [0, 1].
```

---

### Valid Parentheses

> Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

```
Input: "()[]{}" Output: true

Input: "(]" Output: false
```

---

### Trapping Rain Water

> Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

---

### Median of Two Sorted Arrays

> Find the median of the two sorted arrays. 

```
nums1 = [1, 2] nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

-----------------------------

nums1 = [1, 3] nums2 = [2, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

---

### Linked List Deep Copy (Copy List with Random Pointer)

> A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null. Return a deep copy of the list.

```
Input/output: 
    {
        "$id":"1",
        "next":{
            "$id":"2",
            "next":null,
            "random":{
                "$ref":"2"
            },
            "val":2
        },
        "random":{"$ref":"2"},
        "val":1
    }
```
