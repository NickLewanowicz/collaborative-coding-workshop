# What is our goal?

Solve challenging problems and leverage collaboration.

# Why is this valueable? 

There are 2 prevailing methods to enhance knowledge understanding, aquisition, and retention.

1. [Spaced repetition](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/52d7/5ac6080842077877219003dbfbcbea36020f.pdf)
   - Spaced practice enhances memory, problem solving,
and transfer of learning to new contexts.
2. [Learning by teaching](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361476X13000209?via%3Dihub#ab005)
   - Students who actually taught experienced more persistent learning gains.

## So how are we going to accomplish this today?

1. Work on some coding challenges
2. Work within groups to complete them
3. Explain the problem and solution to our group
